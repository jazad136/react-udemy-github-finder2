The plan:

- React 16.8.6 
- React Dom 16.8.6
- React Scripts 3.0.1

As of writing this readme (Aug. 31, 2021)
React 16.8.6 is the last version of React that has [online 
documentation](https://5d4b5feba32acd0008d0df98--reactjs.netlify.app).

### 'npm start'
This command will start this project to test it out. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] 
(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### `npm run build`

#### not a required command. 
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
